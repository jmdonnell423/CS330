Computer Graphics and Visualization This is a repository of my work form CS3330 Computer Graphics and Visualization. Included is my final project.

Scenario
Recall that you work as a C++ and OpenGL 3D graphics developer for Triangle & Cube Studios. This company designs 3D worlds for clients and customizes them based on the varied needs presented by each particular client.

In this professional landscape, the demand for computational graphics and visualizations is continually growing. Your clients may come from the game industry looking for graphics and animations, the healthcare industry for medical visualizations, the entertainment industry for computer-generated imagery (CGI) and visual effects, business industries for 3D printing to create physical objects for applied real-world problem solving, and much more. When you are assigned one of these types of projects, you become responsible for writing code in OpenGL to create objects, apply texture, apply light, render, and control virtual environments relative to a virtual camera.

Your current project with Triangle & Cube Studios is to recreate a 3D version of a 2D image that you have been given by a client. Your client will later be 3D printing this to use as a preliminary concept for their business, so they only need you to create a simple approximation using a few basic shapes.

This project was very interesting and I learned a lot about creating a 3D interactive scene. I went above and beyond the requirements and created many shapes that were beyond the scope of the project. Attached is a reflection of my work as well.

How do I approach designing software?
Designing software begins with understanding the requirements and goals of the project, followed by conceptualizing how each component interacts within the system. For the 3D scene project, the approach involved deciding on key features such as object selection, lighting, and textures that would best demonstrate OpenGL's capabilities, ensuring the design was both functional and engaging.

What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
Working on the project helped in crafting skills related to 3D graphics design, including the strategic placement of objects and light sources to create depth and realism, and the selection and application of textures to enhance the visual appeal and immersion of the scene.

What design process did you follow for your project work?
The design process for the project followed a structured approach: identifying the project's objectives, brainstorming features that meet these objectives, selecting the most impactful features (e.g., varied object types, lighting, texture), and then iteratively designing and refining the scene layout and interactions.

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
Tactics such as focusing on user engagement, leveraging diverse visual elements, and iterative refinement can be applied to future software development projects to enhance user experience and meet project objectives effectively.

How do I approach developing programs?
Developing programs involves planning the software architecture, writing code to implement the planned features, testing for functionality and bugs, and refining based on feedback or test results. For the 3D scene, this meant organizing code into modular functions for specific tasks, such as camera control and texture loading, facilitating easier maintenance and scalability.

What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
New development strategies included modularizing code for better organization, utilizing OpenGL features for realistic rendering, and implementing intuitive user navigation controls similar to those found in video games, enhancing the interaction quality.

How did iteration factor into your development?
Iteration was a critical part of the development process, allowing for continuous refinement of the 3D scene. Starting with basic implementations, features were progressively enhanced, and user feedback was incorporated to improve navigation and visual appeal.

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
The approach evolved from focusing on basic functionalities to enhancing user experience and visual quality. Learning from each milestone, the development process became more efficient, with an increased emphasis on code modularity, readability, and leveraging advanced OpenGL features for a more compelling 3D scene.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Computer science provides a foundation in problem-solving, logical thinking, and technical skills applicable across various domains. For projects like the 3D scene, it offers the tools and methodologies to conceptualize, design, and implement complex digital environments, aiding in achieving goals related to software development, digital art, and interactive media.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
Computational graphics and visualizations offer knowledge in creating and manipulating digital environments, understanding of graphical algorithms, and experience with user interaction design. These skills are valuable in fields such as game development, virtual reality, data visualization, and computer-aided design, enhancing educational pursuits in computer science and related disciplines.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
Skills in computational graphics and visualizations prepare you for roles in software development, digital media, entertainment, engineering, and academia. The ability to create immersive and interactive environments can lead to innovations in how we interact with technology, opening opportunities in emerging fields like augmented reality, 3D modeling, and simulation, thus broadening your professional prospects.
